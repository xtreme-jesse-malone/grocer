**grocer** interfaces with the [Apple Push Notification
Service](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ApplePushService/ApplePushService.html)
to send push notifications to iOS devices.

There are other gems out there to do this, but **grocer** plans to be the
cleanest, most extensible, and friendliest.

## Requirements

* Ruby/MRI 1.9.x, JRuby 1.7.x in 1.9 mode, Rubinius in 1.9 mode

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'grocer'
```

If you are using JRuby, you will also need to add this to enable full OpenSSL support:

```ruby
gem 'jruby-openssl'
```

## Usage

### Connecting

```ruby
# `certificate` is the only required option; the rest will default to the values
# shown here.
#
# Information on obtaining a `.pem` file for use with `certificate` is shown
# later.
pusher = Grocer.pusher(
  certificate: "/path/to/cert.pem",      # required
  passphrase:  "",                       # optional
  gateway:     "gateway.push.apple.com", # optional; See note below.
  port:        2195,                     # optional
  retries:     3                         # optional
)
```

#### Notes

* `certificate`: If you don't have the certificate stored in a file, you
  can pass any object that responds to `read`.
  Example: `certificate: StringIO.new(pem_string)`
* `gateway`: Defaults to different values depending on the `RAILS_ENV` or
  `RACK_ENV` environment variables. If set to `production`, defaults to
  `gateway.push.apple.com`, if set to `test`, defaults to `localhost` (see
  [Acceptance Testing](#acceptance-testing) later), otherwise defaults to
  `gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com`.
* `retries`: The number of times **grocer** will retry writing to or reading
  from the Apple Push Notification Service before raising any errors to client
  code.

### Sending Notifications

```ruby
# `device_token` and either `alert` or `badge` are required.
#
# Information on obtaining `device_token` is shown later.
notification = Grocer::Notification.new(
  device_token:      "fe15a27d5df3c34778defb1f4f3880265cc52c0c047682223be59fb68500a9a2",
  alert:             "Hello from Grocer!",
  badge:             42,
  sound:             "siren.aiff",         # optional
  expiry:            Time.now + 60*60,     # optional; 0 is default, meaning the message is not stored
  identifier:        1234,                 # optional
  content_available: true                  # optional; any truthy value will set 'content-available' to 1
)

pusher.push(notification)
```

It is desirable to reuse the same connection to send multiple notifications, as
is recommended by Apple.

```ruby
pusher = Grocer.pusher(connection_options)
notifications.each do |notification|
  pusher.push(notification)
end
```

### Checking for errors

Grocer will raise a GotErrorResponseException if apns sends back an error while the
connection is open. You can get the identifier of the failing notification from this exception.
It is adviseable that you call Pusher.close() when you have finished sending notifications. This will
close the connection and check for any errors apns may have sent since the last notification was pushed.

```ruby
pusher = Grocer.pusher(connection_options)
begin
  notifications.each do |notification|
    pusher.push(notification)
  end
  pusher.close(2) # argument '2' is an optional timeout value (default is 2)
rescue Grocer::GotErrorResponseException => e
  identifier = e.identifier
  message = e.message
  puts "Message identified by #{identifier} failed citing reason '#{message}'"
end
```

#### Custom Payloads

The Apple documentation says "Providers can specify custom payload values
outside the Apple-reserved aps namespace." To specify a custom payload, set
`Grocer::Notification#custom`.

```ruby
notification = Grocer::Notification.new(
  device_token: "...",
  alert:        "Hello from Grocer",
  custom: {
    "acme2": ["bang", "whiz"]
  }
)

# Generates a JSON payload like:
# {"aps": {"alert": "Hello from Grocer"}, "acme2": ["bang", "whiz"]}
```

#### Passbook Notifications

A `Grocer::PassbookNotification` is a specialized kind of notification which
does not require any payload. That is, you need not (and *[Apple explicitly says
not to](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#Documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Chapters/Updating.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH5-SW1)*)
send any payload for a Passbook notification. If you do, it will be ignored.

```ruby
notification = Grocer::PassbookNotification.new(device_token: "...")
# Generates a JSON payload like:
# {"aps": {}}
```

#### Newsstand Notifications

Grocer also supports the special Newsstand 'content-available' notification. `Grocer::NewsstandNotification` can be
used for this. Like `Grocer::PassbookNotification`, it is a specialized kind of notification which does not require
any payload. Likewise, anything you add to it will be ignored.

```ruby
notification = Grocer::NewsstandNotification.new(device_token: "...")
# Generates a JSON payload like:
# {"aps": {"content-available":1}}
````

### Feedback

```ruby
# `certificate` is the only required option; the rest will default to the values
# shown here.
feedback = Grocer.feedback(
  certificate: "/path/to/cert.pem",       # required
  passphrase:  "",                        # optional
  gateway:     "feedback.push.apple.com", # optional; See note below.
  port:        2196,                      # optional
  retries:     3                          # optional
)

feedback.each do |attempt|
  puts "Device #{attempt.device_token} failed at #{attempt.timestamp}"
end
```

#### Notes

* `gateway`: Defaults to `feedback.push.apple.com` **only** when running in a
  production environment, as determined by either the `RAILS_ENV` or
  `RACK_ENV` environment variables. In all other cases, it defaults to the
  sandbox gateway, `feedback.sandbox.push.apple.com`.
* `retries`: The number of times **grocer** will retry writing to or reading
  from the Apple Push Notification Service before raising any errors to client
  code.

### Acceptance Testing

Grocer ships with framework to setup a real looking APNS server. It listens on
a real SSL-capable socket bound to localhost.

You can setup an APNS client to talk to it, then inspect the notifications the
server received.

The server simply exposes a blocking queue where notifications are placed when
they are received. It is your responsibility to timeout if a message is not
received in a reasonable amount of time.

For example, in RSpec:

```ruby
require 'timeout'

describe "apple push notifications" do
  before do
    @server = Grocer.server(port: 2195)
    @server.accept # starts listening in background
  end

  after do
    @server.close
  end

  specify "As a user, I receive notifications on my phone when awesome things happen" do
    # ... exercise code that would send APNS notifications ...

    Timeout.timeout(3) {
      notification = @server.notifications.pop # blocking
      expect(notification.alert).to eq("An awesome thing happened")
    }
  end
end
```

## Device Token

A device token is obtained from within the iOS app. More details are in Apple's
[Registering for Remote
Notifications](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/IPhoneOSClientImp/IPhoneOSClientImp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH103-SW1)
documentation.

The key code for this purpose is:

```objective-c
- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)app {
   // other setup tasks here....
   [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:(UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound)];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)app didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)devToken {
    NSLog(@"Got device token: %@", [devToken description]);

    [self sendProviderDeviceToken:[devToken bytes]]; // custom method; e.g., send to a web service and store
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)app didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)err {
    NSLog(@"Error in registration. Error: %@", err);
}
```

## Certificate File

Login to the [iOS Provisioning Portal (App IDs)](https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/bundles/index.action).

Configure the appropriate certificate for push notifications and download the
certificate:

![Downloading the Push Notification Certificate](https://img.skitch.com/20120402-gtj3bkqi1kq92kgw2pbr5puk5d.png)

Open the file in Keychain Access, then expand the certificate to show both the
certificate *and* the private key. Command select so both are highlighted:

![Selecting both the certificate and private key](https://img.skitch.com/20120402-e8deartr2uhimaiatgccttkggi.png)

Control click and select to export the 2 items:

![Exporting the certificate and private key](https://img.skitch.com/20120402-mbmgjrybyym846cy58a9kpyxp5.png)

Save the items as a `.p12` file. Open a terminal window and run the following
command:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in exported_certificate.p12 -out certificate.pem -nodes -clcerts
```

The `certificate.pem` file that is generated can be used with **grocer**.
